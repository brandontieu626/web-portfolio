      <p>
        Hey, I'm Brandon! I'm a computer science graduate from the University of
        California, Irvine, with experience in web development, quality
        assurance, and database management systems.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Currently, I'm seeking full-time software engineering opportunities to
        kickstart my career in tech. I'm passionate about the entire software
        development lifecycle—whether it's building, testing, or designing
        software.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Since graduation, I’ve gained experience as a Full-time QA Software
        Engineer Intern at Dassault Systèmes. In addition, I’ve worked on
        personal projects, self-studied Full Stack development, and maintained a
        part-time retail job. I'm excited to leverage my skills, continue
        learning, and contribute to impactful software development in a
        full-time engineering role.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Outside of programming, I enjoy hitting the gym, discovering new music,
        collecting vinyls, catching new movies at theater, and finding new
        places to eat!
