        Hey, I'm Brandon! I'm a computer science graduate from the University of
        California, Irvine looking to get started in tech.

        At the moment, I am actively searching for entry-level and internship
        opportunities in tech to gain industry experience. I enjoy working on
        the different proccesses that go into creating software such as the
        development, testing, and design of software.

      <br />
      <p>
        Post-grad, I've been developing individual projects, self studying Full
        Stack development, and working a part time job. Currently, I'm working
        through different online courses regarding Full Stack development
        learning technologies like React, Node, and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Outside of programming, I enjoy going to the gym, discovering new music,
        watching anime, reading a good book, and going to concerts with friends!{" "}

        (Attack on Titan is my favorite anime!)
