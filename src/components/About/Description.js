      <p>Hey, I'm Brandon. I'm a recent computer science graduate from the University of California, Irvine looking to get started in tech.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        At the moment, I am actively searching for software engineering entry level or internship positions to gain industry experience! 
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Post-grad, I have been working on individual projects and self-studying full stack development.
        Currently, I'm working through Full Stack Open 2022 learning technologies like React, Node, and MongoDB.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Outside of programming, I enjoy reading good books, playing Valorant, gymming, and listening to rap and k-pop! <br/>(My favorite group is LE SSERAFIM!)
